# UAgent

AI Agent Host and Client aligned with UE5.8 official Unreal MCP Server. UAgent provides a local-first desktop workspace for planning, executing, and reviewing AI-assisted workflows — starting with Unreal Engine game development tooling.

## Current Stage: MVP2 MCP Read-only Runtime

The MVP1 TaskEvent product chain now extends to a read-only MCP runtime path. Composer input still creates a `TaskDraft` and submits through `RuntimeClient.submitTask()`, but the desktop adapter can route read-only intent to an MCP read-only runtime when a localhost MCP profile is connected. If MCP is disconnected or invalid, `MockRuntime` remains the fallback/demo/test runtime.

MVP2 supports local MCP connection state, initialize/discovery metadata, Streamable HTTP and legacy HTTP+SSE client transports, session-level `resources/read` and policy-gated `tools/call` JSON-RPC methods, read-only resource/tool intent routing, TaskEvent display, blocked-tool warnings, and diagnostics. It does not perform real UE writes, real LLM/provider API calls, shell/browser/filesystem product behavior, or approval-driven write actions.

## Technology Stack

- **Desktop Shell**: Tauri 2 + React 18 + Vite 5
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.5+ (strict mode)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 9+ monorepo
- **Linting**: ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @uagent/desktop web:dev   # Start Vite dev server (browser preview)
pnpm --filter @uagent/desktop dev        # Start Tauri native dev (requires Rust)
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript checking
pnpm lint         # Static analysis
pnpm test         # Run test suite
```

## Native Build Prerequisites

The Tauri 2 native build requires the Rust toolchain (`rustc` / `cargo`) and platform-specific WebView dependencies. The web frontend (`pnpm --filter @uagent/desktop web:build`) builds without Rust.

## Non-Goals (current stage)

- Real Unreal Engine writes or Editor launch
- Mutating MCP tool calls
- Real LLM API calls or provider integration
- Cloud deployment, auth, or remote services
- Forking or embedding Codex/Claude Code/Cursor/Aider
- Production-level sandboxing, approval workflow, or promote/rollback
